alive
=====

Contained herein are visualizations of how long you have left to live. Lifespan is assumed to be 80 years. Perhaps in future versions, a more realistic lifespan will be chosen (based on historical and projected lifespan averages).

This project was inspired by the following image, which was captioned _"If you are 25 years old, you have this many weeks to live."_
